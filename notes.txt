make new object classes and more collisions updates
make a pause menu where you can calibrate the gyroscope

i cannot keep creating these buttons and text surfaces
manually, i need to make a texts class
- include the state of being clicked, make on for buttons, 
  titles, and regular text. or make a keyword that determines
  what types of text to create 

player live updates very fast to accomdate for past movement
while in pause state. The issue here is that python buffers
up every single line that has passed since the last line
read to catch up to the most recent one. find a fix
